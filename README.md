I'm a software developer with a deep-seated passion for problem-solving. I have rich background in academia, hands-on projects, and real world experience of what it means to be a team. Over the past 8 years I've honed my skills in variety of languages and concepts but with particular focus in Object-Oriented Programming in C# and Java. I'm excited to share some of the highlights of my journey and the challenges Iâ€™ve overcome including complex personal projects, unique challenges and advantages that come from developing in a team, and the importance of understanding and working with a client to create software that has genuine impact.

## Key Areas of Expertise:
- <b>Object-Oriented Programming:</b> specializing in C# (4 years) and Java (3 years)
- <b>Collaboration & Teamwork:</b> Leveraging diverse experiences from 7 years in retail to foster effective team collaboration as well as academic team projects that utilize unique skill sets to plan, design, and implement software solutions.
- <b>Machine Learning:</b> Building intelligent systems using neural networks and algorithms to accomplish complex tasks.
- <b>Other:</b> JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Node.js, MS Access, MongoDB, REST, SDLC, Technical Writing
  
## Featured Projects
### AI Digit Recognizer (Check [here](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/AI-Digit-Recognition.git) to see in-depth documentation)
<b>Technologies:</b> C# | WPF | .Net Framework | Visual Studio

<b>Overview:</b> A sophisticated application that recognizes hand-drawn digits and allows for the users to create and train new neural networks with control over a variety of variables. This project is the culmination of my accumulated knowledge and skills in C#, OOP, machine learning a display in growth for planning, designing, testing complex systems.
