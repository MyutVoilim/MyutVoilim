I'm a software developer with a deep-seated passion for problem-solving. I have rich background in academia, hands-on projects, and real world experience of what it means to be a team. Over the past 8 years I've honed my skills in variety of languages and concepts but with particular focus in Object-Oriented Programming in C# and Java. I'm excited to share some of the highlights of my journey and the challenges I‚Äôve overcome including complex personal projects, unique challenges and advantages that come from developing in a team, and the importance of understanding and working with a client to create software that has genuine impact.

## Key Areas of Expertise:
- <b>Object-Oriented Programming:</b> specializing in C# (4 years) and Java (3 years)
- <b>Collaboration & Teamwork:</b> Leveraging diverse experiences from 7 years in retail to foster effective team collaboration as well as academic team projects that utilize unique skill sets to plan, design, and implement software solutions.
- <b>Machine Learning:</b> Building intelligent systems using neural networks and algorithms to accomplish complex tasks.
- <b>Other:</b> JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Node.js, MS Access, MongoDB, REST, SDLC, Technical Writing
  
## Featured Projects
### AI Digit Recognizer (Check [here](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/AI-Digit-Recognition.git) to see in-depth documentation) üî¢
<b>Technologies:</b> C# | WPF | .Net Framework | Visual Studio

<b>Overview:</b> A sophisticated application that recognizes hand-drawn digits and allows for the users to create and train new neural networks with control over a variety of variables. This project is the culmination of my accumulated knowledge and skills in C#, OOP, machine learning a display in growth for planning, designing, testing complex systems.
  
<b>Features:</b>
- Interactive Digit Recognition: Users can draw digits and see the AI's confidence values in real-time.
- Customizable Neural Network: Ability to create custom neural networks by defining hidden layer sizes and node counts.
- Control Over Training Parameters: Adjust learning rates and epoch counts to influence training efficacy.
- User-Friendly Interface: Includes dynamic visuals, progress bars, accuracy tracking, and confidence value displays.
  
<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Comprehensive Design and Development:</b>Tackled the complexities of designing and implementing a neural network in C# with a strong emphasis on OOP.
- <b>Testing and Reliability:</b> Focused on unit testing to ensure reliability in complex processes, learning valuable lessons in bug detection and system robustness.
- <b>Documentation and Learning:</b> The project was not just a technical challenge but also an opportunity to refine my skills in creating comprehensive documentation and understanding the intricacies of neural network behaviors.

### Maproom Navigation App üìç
<b>Technologies:</b> JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Node.js | JSON | MongoDB

<b>Overview:</b> A collaborative project developed by a team of three using Agile methodologies to create "Maproom," an app designed to assist freshmen in navigating our campus. Our goal was to make the transition to campus life less daunting for new students by providing a user-friendly tool to locate classrooms and facilities.

<b>Features:</b>
- Provides user with the building and floor along with a highlight for the exact room they are look for.
- A campus view and local view for building and room locations
- Intuative search functioantlity that simplifies finding classroom without needing to know the exact building it is in

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Collaboration Across Disciplines:</b> Our team had diverse backgrounds ranging from Business to Computer Science lending each with difference experinces that could be utalized with responsibilities divided based on our areas of expertise. I focused on database management, JavaScript logic for mapping, and developing the search engine.
- <b>Time Management:</b> Balancing development with academic and work commitments. We utilized Gantt charts and meetings to hit weekly targets and had task prioritization.
- <b>Remote Coordination:</b> Leveraged tools like Discord, email, and GitHub for communication and version control, overcoming the challenge of coordinating work across different schedules.

### ATV Repair Shop Database Application üõ†Ô∏è
<b>Technologies:</b> Microsoft Access

<b>Overview:</b> A relational database crafted to streamline operations for an ATV repair shop. Meant to replace their cumbersome physical logging system with a user friends system that allows the client to quickly find customers and their associated repairs.

<b>Features:</b>
- Customer information management to quickly store and retrive customer details 
- Logging of ATV vehical information, Repairs, and other services
- Easy naviation from customer to associated ATVs or ATVs to associated customers.
- Ability to print forms for physical backups

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Client Collaboration:</b> Worked closely with the client to ensure the system met their specific needs. Involved in extensive planning and iterative feedback sessions to fine-tune the system's features and functionalities.
- <b>Business Requirements Analysis:</b> Focused on aligning the database design with the practical business requirements of the repair shop.
- <b>System Design and Presentation:</b> Carefully designed the system with an emphasis on usability, and actively involved the client in the design process to incorporate their feedback and additional functionality requirements.

# More About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello, I'm Thomas. I‚Äôm individual that enjoys and even thrives in problem solving. Whether that be games, philosophy, and most enjoyably software development. Much like any puzzle, once solved you not only learn the solution but get a progressively better at fundamentally understanding the mechanics as play. Each new challenge is an opportunity to develop my understanding and broaden my perspective; This is a philosophy I hold deep to my heart in everything that I do. 

I have a diverse background that spans both a strong academic and personal passion for software development. I‚Äôve tackled the challenges and opportunities that collaboration provides to software development, been driven with the passion create and grow from challenging personal projects, and understand the importance of working with clients to create solutions that have genuine impact.

Over the years with nearly 8 years of retail experience, I know what it means to set aside differences and come together towards a common goal. I‚Äôve met every type of person under the sun and even still meet unique characters that each have their strengths and weaknesses. No matter how efficient you think you are, an individual can never achieve the progress and impact cooperation can. Through communication, compassion, and guidance so many barriers can be crossed to help work towards a common goal. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned over the years, it‚Äôs that people tend to match those around them; If you work with initiative, passion, and kindness more likely then not that will motive those around you to match.

I been programming for nearly 8 years now from JavaScript games in high school to personal and academic projects growing to use an array of languages and concepts. In that journey I‚Äôve spend most of my time specializing in OOP between C# and Java and is my preferred paradigm. For more in depth overviews check out my [Portfolio] be here are highlights showing projects I‚Äôm proud of displaying a variety of important skill sets for team collaboration, working with clients, and challenging projects.
