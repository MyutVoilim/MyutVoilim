### Maproom Navigation App üìç
![Maproom Searching room](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/MyutVoilim/assets/54462267/61fbf744-436a-4cc3-b25a-554510c62482)

<b>Technologies:</b> JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Node.js | JSON | MongoDB | Visual Studio Code

<b>Overview:</b> "Maproom" is a navigation app tailored for new students to effortlessly locate classrooms on campus in unfamiliar surroundings. This project, a collaboration between three team members, embodies a commitment to teamwork and effective organization. Leveraging Agile methodologies, our team effectively managed time constraints and maximized productivity all while mostly working remotely. We prioritized tasks to meet target goals and utilized a range of tools for seamless collaboration. Our user-centric approach involved surveying our target demographic to ensure the app's design was intuitive and impactful. Maproom not only highlights the relevant building but also provides a detailed local view, clearly marking the specific floor and room locations. This project showcases our collective strength, organizational skills, and dedication to making a meaningful software for our target demographic.

<b>Features:</b>
- <b>Dual Navigation Views:</b> Maproom offers a campus-wide view for general orientation and a detailed local view pinpointing the exact room within a building.
- <b>Intuitive Search Functionality:</b> The app enables students to locate classrooms easily without needing prior knowledge of the building location, enhancing user convenience.
- <b>Precise Location Mapping:</b> Users receive clear indications of both the building and floor, along with a highlighted marker for the specific classroom they're searching for.

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</b> Comprising of members with backgrounds in Business and Computer Science, we efficiently divided responsibilities to each other‚Äôs expertise for effective design and development. My role was pivotal in managing the database, developing JavaScript logic for mapping features, and creating a user-friendly search engine.
- <b>Effective Time Management:</b> Juggling academic and work commitments, we utilized Gantt charts and regular meetings to maintain our development schedule, ensuring weekly targets were met through effective task prioritization.
- <b>Remote Team Coordination:</b> Focusing on remote collaboration, we utilized Discord, email, and GitHub for effective communication and version control, facilitating progress despite varied schedules.
- <b>Demographic Needs:</b> This app held an important place in our campus as available maps were uninformative and only provided a campus overview. Surveys and test groups were pivotal in narrowing effective and user-friendly functionality.

## Background üìñ
I have a diverse background that spans both a strong academic and personal passion for software development. I‚Äôve tackled the challenges and opportunities that collaboration provides to software development, been driven with the passion create and grow from challenging personal projects, and understand the importance of working with clients to create solutions that have genuine impact. Over the years with over 7 years of retail experience, I know what it means to set aside differences and come together towards a common goal. I‚Äôve met every type of person under the sun and even still meet unique characters that each have their strengths and weaknesses. No matter how efficient you think you are, an individual can never achieve the progress and impact cooperation can. Through communication, compassion, and guidance so many barriers can be crossed to help work towards a common goal. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned over the years, it‚Äôs that people tend to match those around them; If you work with initiative, passion, and kindness more likely then not that will motive those around you to match.

## My Programming Journey üíª
I been programming for nearly 8 years now from JavaScript games in high school to personal and academic projects growing to use an array of languages and concepts. In that journey I‚Äôve spend most of my time specializing in OOP between C# and Java and is my preferred paradigm. I've completed 127 credits towards a Bachelors in Computer Science that unfortunately was cut short one semester before graduating due to Family issues that took priority. Even so, the desire to take challenges and learn drove the to go to university and still hold true for everything I do including constantly learning new things in software development. I keep a keen eye on recent development in AI and especially look on to things like general intelligence, Virtual reality, and new languages and Frameworks becoming popular.

## Towards The Future üîÆ
I always look on to improve myself regardless if that is developing my programming skills or tackling on pressing life or philosophical issues. I hope to apply all I've learned to help make an impact with a strong team that hold those same ideas and never stop learning.
