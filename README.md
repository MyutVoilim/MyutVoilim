### Hi there 👋
### Introduction
Hello, I'm Thomas. I'm an individual that enjoys and even thrives in problem solving environments whether that be games, philosophy, and most enjoyably software development. Every problem faced is an opportunity to learn and grow as an individual and I hold that philosophy deeply within me in every step I take. I have a diverse background that spans both a strong academic and personal involvement in software development from collaborative programs, to personal challenging passion projects, to working with a client towards a piece of software that can truly make an impact. I’ve worked in retail for 7 years meeting every type of person under the sun in that time. No matter who they are or what background, I’ve learned first hand just how crucial it is to have a team spirit and collaboration to work towards a common goal. We exist to help each other and pass on our knowledge to others for they may do the same. My journey has given me with a unique blend of problem solving, practical skills, technical knowledge, and a deep understanding of teamwork and operational efficiency, all of which I am excited to apply in the field of computer science.

### Professional Experience:

My experiences at Walmart from 2016 to now have been instrumental in developing soft skills that translate to almost any career from team coordination and harmony, problem solving and adaptablity, to diligence in quality work regardless if that is through self-governence or a team. I've had roles that require leadership and intitive and autonomous descsision making to being a team player and accomidating through communication to be as efficient as possible no matter what the role is. These experiences have ingrained in me the importance of clear communication, a collaborative spirit, and an adaptable approach to tasks - qualities that are immensely valuable in software development and any team environment.

### Academic and Personal Projects:

In parallel to my professional life, I have engaged deeply in the world of software devlopment through various academic and personal projects. Most recenty a challenging passion project [AI Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/AI-Digit-Recognition.git) using C#, .NET framework, and WPF to developed a Feedforward Neural Network with backpropagation from scratch. this project stands as the culmination of years of adcademic learning through solo/team projects along with an array of personal projects that have honed my devlopment skill in various areas but in particular OOP. I've experienced the important of proper communication and group effort with my involvement in developing a navigation app as part of a 3 person team where we used an agile development approach with technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, and MongoDB to collaborativly and effictivly devlop impactful software. I've had experience understanding the impact that working with a client has both in a software devlopment life cylce and the passion that comes from providing tailored and genuinlly helpful solutions to the client through the creation of a MS Access database for digital record-keeping and Tax mangement.

Despite having to step back from completing my Bachelor's degree due to family obligations, my time in academia, accumulating 127 credits, was marked by a steadfast commitment to learning and applying the principles of OOP using C# and Java, and practical application in real-world scenarios, such as developing an MS Access form for a client.









### Looking Forward:

As I transition into the realm of computer science and software development, I bring with me a rich tapestry of experiences and skills that go beyond traditional technical roles. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to blend my background in operational leadership with my passion for technology, aiming to contribute to innovative and impactful software solutions.

I invite you to explore my portfolio of projects, each reflecting my dedication to continual learning, problem-solving, and a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact through technology.
