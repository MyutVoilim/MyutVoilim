### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Introduction
Hello, I'm Nick, a dedicated and resourceful individual with a diverse background that spans both hands-on experience in retail operations and a strong academic and personal involvement in software development. My journey has equipped me with a unique blend of practical skills, technical knowledge, and a deep understanding of teamwork and operational efficiency, all of which I am excited to apply in the field of computer science.

### Professional Experience:

My tenure at Walmart, stretching from September 2016 to the present, has been instrumental in developing my capabilities in team coordination, operational management, and problem-solving. In roles ranging from Cap Team 2 to ON Stocking, I have honed skills in autonomous management, effective communication, and meticulous attention to detail. These experiences have ingrained in me the importance of clear communication, a collaborative spirit, and an adaptable approach to tasks - qualities that are immensely valuable in software development environments.

### Academic and Personal Projects:

In parallel to my professional life, I have engaged deeply in the world of computer science through various academic and personal projects. Notably, my work on an AI Digit Recognizer using C#, .NET framework, and WPF, where I developed a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) with backpropagation from scratch, stands as a testament to my technical acumen and passion for innovation. Furthermore, my involvement in developing a navigation app as part of a team, using an agile development approach with technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, and MongoDB, highlights my ability to collaborate effectively in technology-driven projects.

Despite having to step back from completing my Bachelor's degree due to family obligations, my time in academia, accumulating 127 credits, was marked by a steadfast commitment to learning and applying the principles of OOP using C# and Java, and practical application in real-world scenarios, such as developing an MS Access form for a client.

### Looking Forward:

As I transition into the realm of computer science and software development, I bring with me a rich tapestry of experiences and skills that go beyond traditional technical roles. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to blend my background in operational leadership with my passion for technology, aiming to contribute to innovative and impactful software solutions.

I invite you to explore my portfolio of projects, each reflecting my dedication to continual learning, problem-solving, and a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact through technology.
