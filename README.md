I'm a software developer with a deep-seated passion for problem solving. I have rich background in academia with 127 credits towards a BS in computer science that unfortunately was cut short due to family obligations; however, that journey enriched my understanding of software development, collaboration, and fostered a relentless drive to learn and tackle the unknown. Along with that, I have 7 years of real-world retail experience for what it means to set aside differences and leverage collective strengths to achieve remarkable outcomes. Over the past 8 years I've honed my skills in variety of languages and concepts through academia and personal projects, but with particular focus in Object-Oriented Programming in C# and Java. I'm excited to share some of the highlights of my journey and the challenges I‚Äôve overcome including complex personal projects, development as a team, and the importance working with clients towards tailored solutions that have genuine impact.

It not only showcases my proficiency in C#, OOP, and machine learning but also reflects my growth in planning, designing, and testing complex systems. Built with WPF in the .Net framework, this application offers an engaging and intuitive user experience.
  
<b>Features:</b>
- <b>Interactive Design:</b> allowing the user to draw or load digits with real-time confidence value feedback.
- <b>Customizable Neural Networks:</b> featuring the ability to create custom neural networks by defining hidden layer sizes and node counts.
- <b>Adjustable Training Parameters:</b> Control over training parameters such as learning rates and epoch counts to influence training route.
- <b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> Including dynamic visuals, progress bars, accuracy tracking, and confidence value displays.
- <b>Model Management:</b> Save, load, and swap out training data for greater flexibility and experimentation.
  
<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Comprehensive Design and Development:</b> navigated the complexities of implementing a neural network in C#, applying OOP principles to create a robust system.
- <b>Testing and Reliability:</b> : Employed rigorous unit testing to ensure system reliability, which was crucial in identifying and resolving challenging bugs related to the complex journey data takes from the input, processing, backpropagation, and eventually the output.
- <b>Documentation and Learning:</b> The project was not just a technical challenge but also an opportunity to refine my skills in creating comprehensive documentation and understanding the intricacies of neural network behaviors.

<b>Technologies:</b> JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Node.js | JSON | MongoDB | Visual Studio Code

<b>Overview:</b> A collaborative project developed by a team of three using Agile methodologies to create "Maproom," an app designed to assist freshmen in navigating our campus. Our goal was to make the transition to campus life less daunting for new students by providing a user-friendly tool to locate classrooms and facilities.

<b>Features:</b>
- Provides user with the building and floor along with a highlight for the exact room they are look for.
- A campus view and local view for building and room locations
- Initiative search functionality that simplifies finding classroom without needing to know the exact building it is in

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Collaboration Across Disciplines:</b> Our team had diverse backgrounds ranging from Business to Computer Science lending each with difference experiences that could be utilized with responsibilities divided based on our areas of expertise. I focused on database management, JavaScript logic for mapping, and developing the search engine.
- <b>Time Management:</b> Balancing development with academic and work commitments. We utilized Gantt charts and meetings to hit weekly targets and had task prioritization.
- <b>Remote Coordination:</b> Leveraged tools like Discord, email, and GitHub for communication and version control, overcoming the challenge of coordinating work across different schedules.

<b>Technologies:</b> Microsoft Access

<b>Overview:</b> A relational database crafted to streamline operations for an ATV repair shop. Meant to replace their cumbersome physical logging system with a user friends system that allows the client to quickly find customers and their associated repairs.

<b>Features:</b>
- Customer information management to quickly store and retrieve customer details 
- Logging of ATV vehicle information, Repairs, and other services
- Easy navigation from customer to associated ATVs or ATVs to associated customers.
- Ability to print forms for physical backups

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Client Collaboration:</b> Worked closely with the client to ensure the system met their specific needs. Involved in extensive planning and iterative feedback sessions to fine-tune the system's features and functionalities.

# A Little More About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I‚Äôm individual that enjoys and even thrives in problem solving. Whether that be games, philosophy, and most enjoyably software development. Much like any puzzle, once solved you not only learn the solution but get a progressively better at fundamentally understanding the mechanics as play. Each new challenge is an opportunity to develop my understanding and broaden my perspective; This is a philosophy I hold deep to my heart in everything that I do.

## Background üìñ
I have a diverse background that spans both a strong academic and personal passion for software development. I‚Äôve tackled the challenges and opportunities that collaboration provides to software development, been driven with the passion create and grow from challenging personal projects, and understand the importance of working with clients to create solutions that have genuine impact. Over the years with over 7 years of retail experience, I know what it means to set aside differences and come together towards a common goal. I‚Äôve met every type of person under the sun and even still meet unique characters that each have their strengths and weaknesses. No matter how efficient you think you are, an individual can never achieve the progress and impact cooperation can. Through communication, compassion, and guidance so many barriers can be crossed to help work towards a common goal. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned over the years, it‚Äôs that people tend to match those around them; If you work with initiative, passion, and kindness more likely then not that will motive those around you to match.

## My Programming Journey üíª
I been programming for nearly 8 years now from JavaScript games in high school to personal and academic projects growing to use an array of languages and concepts. In that journey I‚Äôve spend most of my time specializing in OOP between C# and Java and is my preferred paradigm. I've completed 127 credits towards a Bachelors in Computer Science that unfortunately was cut short one semester before graduating due to Family issues that took priority. Even so, the desire to take challenges and learn drove the to go to university and still hold true for everything I do including constantly learning new things in software development. I keep a keen eye on recent development in AI and especially look on to things like general intelligence, Virtual reality, and new languages and Frameworks becoming popular.

## Towards The Future üîÆ
I always look on to improve myself regardless if that is developing my programming skills or tackling on pressing life or philosophical issues. I hope to apply all I've learned to help make an impact with a strong team that hold those same ideas and never stop learning.
