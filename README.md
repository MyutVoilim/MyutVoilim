![Maproom Searching room](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/MyutVoilim/assets/54462267/61fbf744-436a-4cc3-b25a-554510c62482)

<b>Technologies:</b> JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Node.js | JSON | MongoDB | Visual Studio Code

<b>Overview:</b> "Maproom" is a navigation app tailored for new students to effortlessly locate classrooms on campus in unfamiliar surroundings. This project, a collaboration between three team members, embodies a commitment to teamwork and effective organization. Leveraging Agile methodologies, our team effectively managed time constraints and maximized productivity all while mostly working remotely. We prioritized tasks to meet target goals and utilized a range of tools for seamless collaboration. Our user-centric approach involved surveying our target demographic to ensure the app's design was intuitive and impactful. Maproom not only highlights the relevant building but also provides a detailed local view, clearly marking the specific floor and room locations. This project showcases our collective strength, organizational skills, and dedication to making a meaningful software for our target demographic.

<b>Features:</b>
- <b>Dual Navigation Views:</b> Maproom offers a campus-wide view for general orientation and a detailed local view pinpointing the exact room within a building.
- <b>Intuitive Search Functionality:</b> The app enables students to locate classrooms easily without needing prior knowledge of the building location, enhancing user convenience.
- <b>Precise Location Mapping:</b> Users receive clear indications of both the building and floor, along with a highlighted marker for the specific classroom they're searching for.

<b>Challenges Overcome:</b>
- <b>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</b> Comprising of members with backgrounds in Business and Computer Science, we efficiently divided responsibilities to each other‚Äôs expertise for effective design and development. My role was pivotal in managing the database, developing JavaScript logic for mapping features, and creating a user-friendly search engine.
- <b>Effective Time Management:</b> Juggling academic and work commitments, we utilized Gantt charts and regular meetings to maintain our development schedule, ensuring weekly targets were met through effective task prioritization.
- <b>Remote Team Coordination:</b> Focusing on remote collaboration, we utilized Discord, email, and GitHub for effective communication and version control, facilitating progress despite varied schedules.
- <b>Demographic Needs:</b> This app held an important place in our campus as available maps were uninformative and only provided a campus overview. Surveys and test groups were pivotal in narrowing effective and user-friendly functionality.

# A Little More About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am deeply passionate about problem-solving, finding joy in what that brings from anything to games, philosophy, and especially software development.  Much like any puzzle, once solved you not only learn the solution but deepen a fundamental understanding to apply to the next puzzle. I approach every challenge as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and perspectives, a philosophy I apply wholeheartedly to all aspects of my life.

## Background üìñ
I‚Äôve always had a passion for problem-solving and gaining knowledge that could be applied to the next endeavor. I grew up with an analytic mindfulness in every task, passionately focused on understanding the logical foundations of my goals, desires, and overall personal philosophy. When I discovered programming, I was immediately infatuated with what was essentially a never-ending puzzle of logic and learning. I was hooked, I made games and simulations in JavaScript until I eventually went to University for computer science to study the thing I loved. A little before University I got a job in retail and experienced first-hand the diversity of characters you'll meet in the real world and the challenges that come with creating an effective team environment. However, through communication, compassion, and adaptability so many barriers can be crossed towards a common goal. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned over the last 7 years, it‚Äôs that people tend to match those around them; If you work with initiative, passion, and kindness more likely than not that will motivate those around you.

## My Programming Journey üíª
My journey through University took me through countless disciplines and concepts from ethics, networking, databases, machine-learning, and paradigms like OOP and functional programming. I developed a strong background in OOP and grew comfortable with its concept using C# and Java. I learned how collaboration across different disciplines can bring expertise that no individual can match in creating amazing projects like Maproom. I also experienced why it is so important to work with clients to create tailored solutions and the approach that must be taken to involve clients into the SDLC for projects like my ATV database. It‚Äôs a shame my academic experience was cut short so close to the finish line with only one semester left and 127 credits complete, but because of that I learned so much and gained an appreciation for the complexity and impact that software development can have. I haven't stopped and don‚Äôt plan on stopping my journey in this field and my AI Digit Recognizer passion project is a testament to that. 

## Towards The Future üîÆ
I will never stop growing as a problem-solver, collaborator, or developer and hope to bring my skills and willingness to learn to an environment that can appreciate these qualities and further my growth. I will always adapt and bring a burning passion to provide quality, not because I need to but because it is something deeply ingrained in my soul. Thank you for taking the time to read all this and I truly wish for the opportunity to apply my journey to something greater than myself.
